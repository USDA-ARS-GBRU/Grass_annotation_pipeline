# Annotation Steps for Grasses


## Step 1: Process RNA-Seq Files

Following the steps given here: https://github.com/PeanutBase/BIND_annotation

# Run FastQC

# Trim Reads

Trim reads using trim-galore and fastp




## Step 2: Masking the genome

Cat both haplotypes of the genome together.

# Run EDTA and soft-masking


## Step 3: Align Reads to the Reference Genome

align reads to genome using HISAT2



## Step 4.A: StringTie




## Step 4.B: Run GeMoMa to predict genes using homology




## Step 5:

## Step 6:



Rename all of the genes according to their order along the genome




## Run Entap
# Download Databases

# Run configeration

# Run entap
